# The Odin Project - 1st Game Jam - Math Attack
This is the repo for our group's (coleModelo, donSwan, allyGato, ThatGUI) project. Math Attack is a math based game inspired by old fighting/beat-em up classics. The game was created for the first ever game jam for The Odin Project, an open-source curriculumn to learn fullstack web development.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

We tried to build the game using basic technologies, sticking with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<!-- ## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing. -->
